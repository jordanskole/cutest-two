                  Raised as a wild child in New Hampshire, where the moutains meet the sea, Jordan moved to Pure Michigan in 1999. He attended high school in Lansing, and discovered his passions at LCC. It wasn't until he transfered to MSU to study economics that he met Heather. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jordan instantly recognized that he was in trouble when he caught himself falling in love with his roommate. During the summer of 2007, Heather and Jordan were inseperable, a trend that has continued ever since. Their adventures together have taken them to far corners of the earth, and will continue to propel them into one of life's greatest adventures in 2014.

                    I haven't known Ben my whole life, but I have known him for all of his. As my only brother, Ben and I spent our childhood running around the woods of New Hampshire together. We were together when we moved to Michigan in 1999, and we have been best friends our entire lives.

                    One of my favorite memories of Steve and my friendship happened when we were in middle school. Steve's mom was out of town, and his sister Kiki had been tasked with watching him. It didn't take much for us to convince Kiki to let us hide in the basement until Steve got home. <br>
                    For all his size and facial hair, Steve is actually the kindest of souls, he even fightens easily! We waited until he got comfortable (as he could be) before we fired up the circular saw in his basement and let out a howl. Good thing we planted the cameras at the front door!

                    I've spent almost as much time living with Kevin as I have with Heather. Kevin and I signed the lease on our first apartment together before I was even 18, and I officially moved in on the morning of my 18th birthday. For years we continued our expansion of East Lansing real estate, always having the place to be. <br>
                    Life hasn't always been as good as it is with Heather, as coming of age brings with it a fair set of heartbreak. Through all of the ups and downs Kevin and I have been there to support and love each other like brothers.

                    Brandon and I were friends in high school, but it wasn't really until college that we became close friends. Brandon was always there in times of adventure, a level ship sailing in a sea of crazy. Brandon went to college in Oakland, so when Heather and I started dating he was there to show me around Rochester Hills. Brandon and Natasha are always up for a game night, and are one of our favorite couples couples.

                    Grease covered hands and messy garages told the story of Hubbard and I. Friends since middle school shop classes we were always tinkering with something. If it was building speaker system that would peel the roof off a Buick or some sort of home-made artilary we would build it. It's no wonder that John grew up to be one of the smartest people I know. Even though we are full-fledged adults now, that doesn't stop John from putting his skills to the work of mischief.

                    Terren and I have been friends since middle school. All the way back when our shop teacher would scream at the whole group of us for misbehaving.

We could have never imagined that one day I would be marrying the most beautiful woman on earth, and Terren would be standing up in my wedding.

                  <p class="flex-caption">
                    Monika and I met in middle school and have remained close after all these years. We were partners in crime in college, living together for 2 years. She is such a fun friend who is always up for anything.

                  <p class="flex-caption">
                    Erin and I literally have the exact same silly sense of humor, so naturally, I LOVE to be around her and laugh my butt off! We met in high school and our families became very close. I've always thought of Erin as kind of a sister. She is such an amazing person and has always been so wonderful a friend.

                    Katie is my littlest cousin by a wee bit. She came along and has been fanciful since day one! She is smart as a whip and artisticly talented, too. Katie has grown to be such a beautiful girl and I'm so happy to have her as my junior bridesmaid.
